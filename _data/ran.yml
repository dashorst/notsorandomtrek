This is a very special episode of TNG where we learn about the perils of addiction and the questionable tactic of having your entire planet’s economy depend on one crop. Interesting fashion, the allure of TNG, and questions about Dr. Crusher’s medical acumen are all discussed as is the Prime Directive and how Capt. Picard seems to apply it capriciously in this episode.</p>
