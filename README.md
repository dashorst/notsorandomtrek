# The Not So Random Trek Web Site

A companion website that derandomizes the [Random Trek podcast](https://www.theincomparable.com/randomtrek) episodes.

This website is static and built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

The episode data lives in the folder `_data/series.yml`.

The main page is built in `/index.html`.

This is still a work in progress (and will remain so I think until Random Trek has recorded its final episode).

## TODO

Here's a list of todo's:

- [ ] Add ~Deep Space 9~, Voyager and Enterprise episodes
- [ ] Add direct links to Random Trek episodes to overcast.fm's website for direct playing
- [ ] Add links to imdb for each episode
- [ ] Fix the UI such that the tabs work correctly
- [ ] Style the UI to look much better
- [ ] Style the UI to work on a small screen
